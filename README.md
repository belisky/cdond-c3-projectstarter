# Udapeople

This is **AWS** Cloud Devops project in which i built a **Blue-Green CI/CD** pipeline using **CircleCI** that:

- Sets up both frontend and Backend Infrastructure using AWS cloudFormation templates,
- Gives email/Slack notifications after a job fails,
- Rolls back changes when there is a failed job in the deployment pipeline,
- Monitors the state of Infrastructure(Servers) involved using prometheus.
- Automatically configures Node-exporter jobs on servers using Ansible.
- Gives email notifications when the Backend server is down etc

## Give your Application Auto-Deploy Superpowers 
### Udacity Cloud Devops Engineer (Project 3)

In this project,I proved mastery of the following learning objectives:

- Explain the fundamentals and benefits of CI/CD to achieve, build, and deploy automation for cloud-based software products.
- Utilize Deployment Strategies to design and build CI/CD pipelines that support Continuous Delivery processes.
- Utilize a configuration management tool to accomplish deployment to cloud-based servers.
- Surface critical server errors for diagnosis using centralized structured logging.
